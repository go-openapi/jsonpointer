# description: |
#   A fast vulnerability scan on the repo that effectively supplements ossf scorecard and codesql
#   and may run every day.
#
#   * trivy reports are often more easily actionable than codeql reports.
#   * govumnscan supplements this analysis with a more go-specific approach
#
# NOTE: at this moment, we don't want to adopt snyk, which requires a token, provides an extra dashboard etc.
# Most likely, snyk would be redundant with trivy.
